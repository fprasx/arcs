AtomicRefCell
7FEB2022
Started implementing atomic refcell which might be incorporated
into thread safe vec
maybe something like Vec<AtomicRefCell<T>>

8FEB2022
I realized that the borrow-state of the refcell cannot be implemented
with an enum, as modifications wouldn't be atomic. I'm going to use an 
AtomicIsize instead. -1 means mutably borrowed, 0 means unborrowed,
and anything greater is the number of immutable borrows 

Realization: In general, I know how to implement the AtomicRefCell. 
However, as I was implementing it the first time, I tried to implement 
too many things at once. By the time I realized the basic flaw of my 
implementation, it was too late. Next time, I'm going to start by implementing
one thing at a time and writing more tests from the get go.

Going to start with implementing a simple vector for practice. Then,
will make pushing and popping thread safe.
